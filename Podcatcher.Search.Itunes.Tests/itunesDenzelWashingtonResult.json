A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli (Denzel Washington) seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize. Driven by this commitment and guided by his belief in something greater than himself, Eli does what he must to survive--and continue. Only one other man in this ruined world understands the power Eli holds, and is determined to make it his own: Carnegie (Gary Oldman), the self-appointed despot of a makeshift town of thieves and gunmen. Meanwhile, Carnegie's adopted daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) is fascinated by Eli for another reason: the glimpse he offers of what may exist beyond her stepfather's domain.",

Their extraordinary efforts ultimately secure his release, leaving \"Hurricane\" to sum up his 20 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit by simply stating, \"Hate got me into this place; love got me out.\" Don't miss the movie Rolling Stone called, \"A stirring fight for freedom! Denzel Washington at his powerful, poignant best!\"",

Blige, and 50 Cent. Boxing has long given kids from America’s roughest neighborhoods the opportunity to escape violence with violence. But in a sport where careers are made and broken in the blink of an eye, and whose athletes are often ill-equipped for the fame and fortune that accompany a title belt, one question remains… What does it take to be a champ?",

      "longDescription": "The March is the feature documentary narrated by Denzel Washington about the renowned and historic 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. A watershed moment of the civil rights movement, the March brought together a huge coalition of powerful and revered civil rights organizations, labor unions, and civil rights leaders. It was to become the biggest civil protest in American history. This film tells the unknown stories which led to the March; the fierce opposition from the U.S. government to it happening; the heroic endeavors to fundraise and organize the March by hundreds of committed civil rights activists, and the presence of huge Hollywood actors who added 'glamour' to the solemn call for equality. This is the titanic story of the unfolding personal and public dramas; threats of violence, subterfuge fears of violent racial disturbances that were overcome to make the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom the biggest peaceful demonstration to take place in the United States to date. The March was to become a catalyst for the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the beginnings of the legacy of freedom for all American citizens, and The March is the story of the defiance of discrimination and victory told by the people who made it happen and whose lives it changed forever.",
